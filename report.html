			<article id="webStandards">For my website, I had to learn about web standards and ways to implement them. Modern web standards are becoming more and more essential every day which is why the rules around them are tightening. In an age where technology is so rapidly evolving and efficient machine learning is already here, it is important that we build our websites to be the most uniform and formulaic they have ever been. Search algorithms are everywhere you look online in the modern world, from google to amazon to advertisement and geolocational services, it all comes down to sorting algorithms that try to make sense of it all. As websites get more and more complicated, the importance of having software capable of sorting through them increases dramatically, and to keep work to a minimum, we must follow web standards. The three key important topics when discussing web standards are: Interoperability, accessibility and usability. Interoperability being how well the website works across multiple devices, software versions and screen sizes. Accessibility refers to how universally accessible the website is to all people with varying backgrounds and disabilities, a common consideration would be colour blind modes, now available in nearly all major games and browsers. Usability can apply to any one at any stage of the websites development, anywhere between the initial programmer and the end consumer, it is important to have predetermined file structures, naming conventions, easily visible navigation menus, tool tips and much more. Usability is important because it can make the difference between a frustrating experience and a fantastic one. It is important to have good naming conventions and well commented code so that any other developer that would like to maintain your website can easily identify issues and fix them and improve existing systems without breaking anything. Across the development cycle, I learned how to apply all these things. The structure of the html code of the index page has clear naming conventions with easy to follow structure, there is no inline styling (except for the occasional embedded video), separate script files, strict naming convention for style sheets/javascript and html files. I considered the accessibility of the website by including a colour-blind toggle and only using colour schemes that do not contrast too much. The website works quite well across most modern browsers however it has not been tested on browsers before IE7 etc. The main index page scales well across multiple device sizes and browsers, having options layouts for desktop computers/tablets and smartphones. One issue I never got around to resolving was the way I handled the local storage. The local storage does work, but I would have preferred if I had interacted with the pseudo styles (a:hover etc) in the css files but I couldnâ€™t work out how to do it in the available time remaining. </article>
